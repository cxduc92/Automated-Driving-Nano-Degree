# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

### Project change log
* Ver 0.0 : Initial submission on 04.07.2020

### Goals
In this project the goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. The car's localization and sensor fusion data will be provided, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

### Project folder structure
* Implementation code is folder [src](./src)
* Report is documented in file [README.md](./README.md)
* The data file is stored in folder `data`

## Rubric Points
Each of the rubric points given in project specifications are discussed below.

#### Compilation
The code compiles without any errors.

#### Valid Trajectories
* The car is able to drive at least 4.32 miles without incident. However, the collision happens after 12 miles.
* The car drives according to the speed limit.
* Max Acceleration and Jerk are not Exceeded.
* Car does not have collisions.
* The car stays in its lane, except for the time between changing lanes.
* The car is able to change lanes.

#### Reflection
The trajectory generation in this project has been performed by:
* Analysing other vehicles (a.k.a targets) on the highway around (front, left, right) ego vehicle (lines 288 - 336).

* Planning appropriate safe behavior (keep lane, lane change left or lane change right; lines 338 - 375).

* Generating waypoints and fitting a spline through those waypoints for a jerk free and smooth trajectory. Waypoints and curve fitting is discussed in detail below.

### Waypoints 

* Waypoints (0, 1): These are generated from previous path trajectory to ensure continuity. In case there aren't enough points, waypoints are generated by using car position (waypoint: 1) and creating a point tangent to car yaw at unit distance behind the car (lines 392 - 426).

* Waypoints (2, 3, 5): These are generated by looking 30m, 60m and 90m ahead of current car s frenet coordinate in the given "lane" (lines 428 - 440). 

### Curve Fitting
An open source spline library (reference: https://github.com/ttk592/spline/) is used for fitting a smooth and jerk free curve through the generated waypoints. Before fitting a curve however, the waypoints are transformed into car's frame of reference to avoid singularities and other numerical problems (lines 442 - 458).

The fitted curve is then used to generate equally spaced points (depending upon the commanded  reference velocity for current cycle) in car's frame of reference. Finally, these points are pushed on to vector of x/y values before transforming them back into inertial frame of reference (lines 474 - 498).

Note:
* Before points from spline are pushed, previous path points are pushed to ensure continuity (lines 461 - 465).
* Speed is regulated cycle to cycle (lines 476 - 481).

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.
