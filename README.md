Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program project files and notes.

This repository contains project files for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program which I started working on on May 15th, 2020.

The Self-Driving Car Engineer is an online certification intended to prepare students to become self-driving car engineers. The program was developed by Udacity in partnership with Mercedes-Benz, NVIDIA, Otto, DiDi, BMW, McLaren and NextEv.

### 2. Deep Learning
Project 3: Behavioural Cloning (Train a car to drive in a 3D simulator using CNN convoluted neural network)

Project 4: Traffic Sign Classifier (Classify german traffic sign)

### 3. Sensor Fusion, Localisation and Control
Project 5: Extended Kalman Filters

Project 6: Kidnapped Vehicle (Particle Filter)

Project 7: PID Controller

### 4: Path Planning, Controlling a Self-Driving Car
